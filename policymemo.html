  <h1> Policy Memo </h1>
  
  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>As music therapy continues to become a more widespread treatment option, the relationship between music and the brain has become vital to the legitimacy of the field. Proponents of music-based therapies point toward the countless recorded benefits that patients have experienced as reason for making music therapy a healthcare necessity; available to all, and covered by insurance. But detractors point toward the lack of widespread studies in many areas of the field as justification for deeming music therapy to be a “luxury”.</p>

  <p>After sifting through decades of research in three different areas of neurologic music therapy, there are some common conclusions that can be reached. Firstly, there is sufficient and empirical evidence that music therapy can have a positive effect on the brain. This lends credence to the argument that music therapy should be viewed as a human necessity, in the same way that other therapeutic treatments are. Secondly, there is currently an insufficient amount of evidence to support widespread adoption of many current neurologic music therapy techniques. While an overwhelming amount of studies point toward a connection between music and brain, there are simply too many inconsistencies, and too few widespread studies, for neurologic music therapy to be adopted on a global scale. It is for this reason, that we propose increased funding for the research of relationships between music and the brain, covering topics including, but not limited to: sensorimotor rehabilitation, memory loss rehabilitation, and learning disabilities. These studies must take into account a widespread array of factors including cultural upbringing and musical background. As such, we present three pieces of evidence below that support both the vitality of neurologic music therapy, as well as the need for more extensive research.</p> 

 

    <h3>Background</h3>

  <p>Take, for example, a 1991 study conducted by cognitive neuroscientists Severine Samson and Robert Zatorre. After presenting text, via a song, to patients who had received a temporal lobectomy, they came to the conclusion that a song’s melody and a song’s lyrics are processed separately, and in different ways, by the brain. This idea that music can potentially provide an alternate method of information delivery has become one of the core talking points for proponents of music as a learning tool. However, in their accompanying paper, Samson and Zatorre touch on the fact that right-brain lobectomies can have a negative impact on tone recognition, meaning that the data collected could have been skewed by factors other than what they were attempting to prove.</p>

  <p>Also, another research study by Melissa Brotons and Susan M. Koger (year of publication) from Willamette University supports music as a tool to decrease symptoms in patients suffering from varying types of dementia. For example, patients with neurological disorders who followed music therapy showed better speech fluency and fewer anxieties, because musical interventions affect their mood and depression underlying with a bidirectional association between depression and neurological disorders possibly are related to neurological disease. There have been no large studies on the benefits of music therapy to Alzheimer's patients. However, music has been shown to calm agitation in late-stage Alzheimer's, although it's not clear whether it helps with cognition or over the long term. Therefore, there needs to be more research on cost-effective and creative non-pharmacological therapies to ensure we have an adequate system of care and supervision.</p>

  <p>One more large domain where music therapy has shown promising results is sensorimotor rehabilitation after stroke or brain injury. In the field of sensorimotor rehabilitation, a term Music Supported Therapy (MST) is used to identify therapeutic interventions where rhythmic auditory cueing technique is used along with one of the conventional therapy techniques (﻿Hatem et al., 2016). The technique relies on the auditory-motor synchronization and the concept of neuronal oscillator entrainment (Hatem et al., 2016; ﻿Lezama-Espinosa & ﻿Hernandez-Montiel, 2020; ﻿Magee et al., 2017;). Multiple systematic reviews provide comprehensive evidence that post-stroke sensorimotor rehabilitation utilizing MST gives a better result when compared with conventional techniques (e.g. not involving music), particularly in gait rehabilitation (Devlin et al., 2019; Fotakopoulos & ﻿Kotlia, 2018; Hatem et al., 2016; Magee et al., 2017). At the same time, the reviews do not explicitly report side effects of music supported therapy, while other kinds of supportive therapy such as invasive brain stimulation or pharmacological ones have obvious negative side effects.</p>

 

  <h3>Analysis</h3>

  <p>The evidence presented in the research outlined above highlights several significant points regarding music therapy as a valid intervention, when compared to other types of interventions. First, the benefits of music therapy as an intervention have been supported time and time again via the means of empirical scientific research. While the above studies have a number of limitations, both general limitations and experiment-specific limitations, the results adhere to modern scientific standards (e.g., in terms of study designs and statistical significances). Thus, the validity of music therapy based treatment is comparable to other types of interventions. Second, we can conclude that music therapy interventions have a very limited amount of side effects when compared with other types of interventions, particularly those such as pharmacological and surgical interventions.</p>

  <p>The notion that music therapy (1) has empirical evidence of its benefits and (2) has very little number of side effects justifies its placement on the same level as other kinds of interventions, both in terms of accessibility (e.g. insurance coverage) and widespread adoption amongst  practitioners. As such, we strongly encourage policymakers to consider a system in which not only is music therapy available, but is economically viable, scientifically respected, and culturally supported.</p>
